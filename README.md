# image-comparison-sources

This set of scripts allows to generate compressed images, calculate metrics
for each quality, average the results and then plot graphs in order to 
to make a comparison of several codecs.

## rd_collect.py

Generate compressed images from PNGs and calculate quality and speed metrics 
for a given format. It takes 3 arguments:

 - Arg 1: the codec format to test.
 - Arg 2: the name of the subset to test (e.g. 'subset1').
 - Arg 3: the path to the subset to test (e.g. 'subset1/').

## rd_select.py

Select images among the ones generated by rd_collect.py at fifth quality 
levels (lossless, large, medium, small and tiny) in order to publish it on 
the website. This step is optional.

It takes the same arguments as rd_collect.py.

## rd_average.py

Calculate for each format the weighted averages for the metrics generated 
by rd_collect.py. It takes 2 arguments:

 - Arg 1: Path to the results of a subset generated by rd_collect.py.

    For ex: rd_average.py 'results/subset1'.

 - Arg 2: Reference format with which to compare other formats.

    If ommited, default to 'mozjpeg'.

## rd_plot.py

Generate a plot for each quality metrics based on the results generated 
with rd_average.py. It takes 2 arguments:

 - Arg 1: Path to a subset with results generated by rd_average.py.

    For ex: rd_plot.py 'results/subset1'.

 - Arg 2: Comma-separated list of formats to plot.

    For ex: 'bpg,mozjpeg,flif,vp9'.
