# image-comparison-sources

This set of scripts allows to generate compressed images, calculate metrics
for each quality, average the results and then plot graphs in order to 
to make a comparison of several codecs.

## recipes.json

recipes.json is a JSON formatted files containing the settings for the codec
formats to test. You can add new ones easily if you respect the structure:

 - quality_start: the quality at which to stop decoding
 - quality_end: the quality at which to stop encoding
 - quality_step: the interval of quality between two settings
 - encode_extension: the extension for encoded images
 - decode_extension: the extension for decoded images
 - encode_cmd: the command for encoding at a given quality
 - lossless_cmd: the command for encoding at a lossles quality
 - decode_cmd: the command for decoding the encoded image
 - export_to_png: set to true if you want the images selected with rd_select.py
 to be exported in PNG. It is useful is the encoded format is not recognized by
 the browser.

Variables recognized:

 - $quality: the quality parameter
 - $target: the filename of the encoded image
 - $target_dec: the filename of the decoded image
 - $origpng, $origpng_y4m, $origpng_ppm: the original image to compress, 
 in PNG, Y4M, or PPM format.

## rd_collect.py

Generate compressed images from PNGs and calculate quality and speed metrics 
for a given format. It takes 3 arguments:

 - Arg 1: the codec format to test.
 - Arg 2: the name of the subset to test (e.g. 'subset1').
 - Arg 3: the path to the subset to test (e.g. 'subset1/').

## rd_select.py

Select images among the ones generated by rd_collect.py at fifth quality 
levels (lossless, large, medium, small and tiny) in order to publish it on 
the website. This step is optional.

It takes the same arguments as rd_collect.py.

## rd_average.py

Calculate for each format the weighted averages for the metrics generated 
by rd_collect.py. It takes 2 arguments:

 - Arg 1: Path to the results of a subset generated by rd_collect.py.

    For ex: rd_average.py 'results/subset1'.

 - Arg 2: Reference format with which to compare other formats.

    If ommited, default to 'mozjpeg'.

## rd_plot.py

Generate a plot for each quality metrics based on the results generated 
with rd_average.py. It takes 2 arguments:

 - Arg 1: Path to a subset with results generated by rd_average.py.

    For ex: rd_plot.py 'results/subset1'.

 - Arg 2: Comma-separated list of formats to plot.

    For ex: 'bpg,mozjpeg,flif,vp9'.
